    # Defines a color in ARGB (Alpha, Red, Green, Blue) hex format (0xaarrggbb) which will be applied to the smoke.
    # The alpha channel of this color (aa) determines probability of applying (ff - always, 7f - 1/2, 00 - never).

    # Id is a basic unit (block or item) identifier in <modId:unitName:meta> format.
    # ModId can be omitted for vanilla items. Meta can be omitted too if it equals 0.
    # UnitName must be lowercase, words separated by '_', words order - from private to common (example: black_iron_ore).
    # Use '*' char or '[]' as meta value to specify all possible values (all block states).
    # To define multiple block states, you can use block properties. The format is <modId:blockName:[prop1=value1, prop2=value2]>
    # Also you may use tags. The format is <#modId:tagPath> (example: #forge:ores/copper).

    # This parameter is required only for those blocks that use NBT tags to fully identify themselves.
    # The format is <tagKey>=<value>

    # Leave this blank if you don't need it. [default: ]

    S:relatedBlocks <

    # Defines the type of this emitter.
    # Valid types (case insensitive):
    #   BLOCK - a simple Block without a Tile Entity that will be updated each time it receives a random tick.
    #   TILE - a Block with a Tile Entity that will be updated onces per second.
    #   ENTITY - a mobile Entity that will be updated onces per second.
    #   FUEL - a Tile Entity with a HARDCODED hook that will be updated each time it consumes fuel. [default: TILE]
