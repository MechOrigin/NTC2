	[settings.allowForAllEffectSources]
		#Should effects from any source stack or just for potions that players drink
		#Set to true and effects from any source will stack, i.e. potions/splash/lingering/arrows/beacons/from mobs hits like hunger from husks etc..
		#and will apply to any entity that the potion effect can be applied to if allowAllEntities=true.
		#Set to false to only allow effect stacking from potions that players drink.

		#Should effects stack on all entities or just players
		#Set to 'false' to only allow stacking on players

		#This is area effects like beacons
		#If allowForAllEffectSources=false this has no effect

		#Minimum effect duration able to stack
		#This is useful to only allow stacking if the effects duration is above this amount
		#Example: If a modded armor adds a 15 second permanent effect set this to 16 seconds (640) to not stack the effects on the armor
		#Any effect that has a lower duration than this will not stack, so this will affect splash potions as there duration depends on how much of the splash you get
		#If allowForAllEffectSources=false this has no effect
		#Range: 0 ~ 24000

	#Potion Effect Blacklist
	[settings.potionEffectsBlacklist]

	#Potion Effect Caps
	[settings.potionEffectCaps]
		#A list of effects max amplifier & duration caps.
		#Default max amplifier is 50 & duration is 30000 (25m).
		#Format: modid:potion_effect_name|amplifier_cap|duration_cap, Example: ["minecraft:jump_boost|94|24000", "minecraft:speed|200|72000"]

	#Notes:
	[settings.notes]
		#By default minecraft's inventory gui will only display the effect level up to 10 (X) and after that will just have the effect name,
		#The duration will only show up to 27:17 and after that will just display xx:xx
		#So I have added a keybinding to display a player message with the current effects info, by default the button is 'n' but can be set in options controls.
		#Some effects just don't work or have odd behaviour above a certain level, for instance jump boost in sp above level 128 you can no longer jump, in server same happens if above around level 94.
		#Slowness above level 6 & you can no longer move, figured this could easily be used to grief players so would probably want to blacklist or set the amplifier cap & duration cap.
		#So you will most likely want to test any effects and figure out what amplifier caps to set & what to blacklist.
		#I have only allowed for hours/minutes/seconds for the duration so if you go above 23:59:59 I'm not sure what that will look like.
