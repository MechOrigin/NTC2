Thanks to Direwolf20 for giving me insight on how to improve the playing experience of NTC2!

Add quest info to clay quest, point to ex nihilo
Make it more clear that you get ice chunks from quest to get water
Make pollution chapter more clear, update it with new mechanics like what blocks it changes and stuff from the custom configs
Make it more clear that crucibles can use leaves to get water
Disable bronze sword from mek
Make a use for cinnabar
Make it really obvious that liquid experience and sulfur can make blaze powder
Add "Yeah no kiddin chief -Direwolf20" to thermal machine frame quest lol
Make it very clear you can get very easy EMC from mob caging vindicators for emeralds
fix creeper heads temperature
buff the amount of blocks the advanced filters eat, 16 is too small
Add rewards for thermal machines quests
make entangled a quest and explain its use

add tooltip to semi stable ingots lol (poor dire)
fix soul steel not converting blocks to ingots etc
disable RF tools ores in JEI
give rf tools frame quest reward - sorry dire
fix mekanism tanks not having recipes

Notes:

PackMode mod seems interesting

More Plates Revamped good for gears and plates

Ultimate Solar Panels seems cool


Isometric Renders is neat 

small ships is cool

fins and tails is cool

alex's mobs is cool

lag removal is a server only mod, looks good

xnet might be a solution to transfer issues as mekanism requires configurator

Gobber mod looks cool (adds rings etc)

advancement plaques looks cool
simply light

chunk animator looks cool (kinda like rlcraft)

entity culling

bumblezone is neat

agricraft

that future mod

compressium

water can

regrowth

find a way to balance chemlib and projecte

simple splash screen 

upgrade aquatic
artifacts
dustrial decor
tank null
advanced peripherals
cc: tweaked
alex's mobs
aquaculture2
engineers decor
macaws stuff
small ships
atmospheric
project vibrant journeys
ftb ultimine (might be better than excavator)
dungeons plus (warped garden)


cute jungle:-1925543368268057290

TAIGA 2 - adds cool tconstruct alloys ect

Additional Enchanted Miner
bc pipes






NTC2

Balance mekanism like NTC and add pollution so that it balances the RF process

Advanced rocketry searching for high value planets,
Making more planets vital. Prevent having to do 1 mining trip and done. Setup asteroid mining so that it brings in exotic materials.

Don't have all individual components for a recipe as a quest. Just explain how to craft it in the quest.
Make branches of quests for creative items and regular items so that you can pick either one. 
For example need 600 mana pools to make the wand of bifrost to make the portal or the option is to make the creative pool instead. 
Too much linearity and not enough options is bad.

Randomness of combat is bad game play and don't have random champion spawns

Microcrafting all the way through tiers of things without providing a way to craft it later on. 
For example using uumatter to craft tier 4 instead of having to craft tier 1,2,3 again.

Interesting automation challenges, refer to divine journey for interesting design challenges

Think rewards through, don't give chance rewards with crazy items in them.

Insane high rf costs for mundane things

Quests with info as to why you're making these items

Again, using mods that are grindy and annoying to hinder progression with no way around them. Refer to PO3

Making end game dependant on slow machines is bad.

Again, to give 2 or more progression routes so you have the choice of bypassing the mod you least want to play.


Progression:

Automating EMC is as complicated as piping items into relay and "powering" a Star.

Make nether have cobalt veins, cobalt is only accessible in the nether.

Make immersive engineering more of a integrated part of the pack. Make immersive engineering required to make a IF miner.

Industrial foregoing has a miner. Use that to get a lot of resources.

After thermal and industrial foregoing is made available must get into AR.

Make cobalt, and whatever used to make If miner (probably HOP coke) craftable with uumatter.

AR requires makes satellite and observer to find asteroids with exotic materials to progress into mekanism.

Mekanism uses chemlib extensively to hinder progression.

set up end and nether dims to load properly

fixed thermal oil from IF fluid drill to be immersivepetro crude oil
made some quests for 8x, 16x, 32x ore processing
added star recipes to make it more feasible to craft. Non of this 137billion mobius fuel needed or 10billion diamonds



1.4.1:
Fixed some fancy menu stuff
Changed topaddons to 3 instead of 0
Thanks Kithi:
    A preliminary note that in version .18/.19 of projectexpansion, EMC Link tier isn't respected between world loads and requires them to be picked up and replaces to properly use the right tier limits, this is fixed in .20 when that's updated to
    They all default to the basic mk1 tier, not sure how it's affected by unloaded tile entities as I never tested that case
    But if people start noticing slow output/input of items through them, that's why and breaking and replacing them fixes it temporarily until new version is pushed to modpack
Added emc to fuels and fix fuels emc to compensate for fuels used
Removed ae2infinitybooster
Fixed tinkers slime boots quest gone
Fixed tantrum bug heart containers cant fill more than 20 hearts, changed to 60 hearts
Updated projectexpansion
Removed the ae2 ender dust recipe from the pulse centrifuge and fixed the duplicates, fixed an issue in the json trying to read amount instead of count, fixes not outputing 2 gems vs 1
updated lazierae2 to fix a couple bugs: recipe output amount not being correctly serialized, insertion/extraction not correctly respecting the side configuration
updated projectexpansion
updated spark
added upgrade slots for assembler and slice'n'splice
fixed centrifuge recipes not giving back correct emc links
Added time in a bottle singularity for WoFT recipe
fixed custom machine pollution showing recipes for machine blocks
Added EMC values to Klein Star Omega, Magnum Omega, Colossal Omega (for QOL)
Fixed Omega star recipes to reflect the changes to fuel/matter
Added WoFT recipe
Quest Witherproof Block should have an OR condition for mysticalagriculture:witherproof_block and mysticalagriculture:witherproof_glass and bricks
Added menril and chorus singularity
Changed nuclear fuels to output non spent nuclear waste instead
Added a bunch of ingot singularities and uumatter, antimatter, californium-250
Fixed block recipes for end resin processor
Changed final star and final star shard recipe




remove mekanism matter and remake everyting in kubejs

Might want to add MultiBlock Stages at some point? idk
    



//use alchemical imbuer as enricher
use pulverizer as manufactory
use fluid encapsulator as infuser
use centrifuge as extractor
use blast chiller as ingot former
use frac still as supercooler
use servo press as pressurizer
use nucleosynthesizer as target_chamber
use crystallizer in mek (gotta convert to gas first, oof)
use injector in mek as irradiator
use chemical dissolution chamber as enricher

create collision_chamber and accelerator
collision_chamber: 2 input fluid, 4 output fluid, item input
//proton gas made from hydrogen gas in accelerator

//use collision_chamber to shoot 2 protons to make positrons, deuterium, electron neutrino
//proton fluid, positron fluid, electron neutrino fluid, tau fluid, anti-proton
//use collision_chamber to shoot positron and electron neutrino to make tau
//use collision_chamber to shoot protons at lead to make proton, anti-proton fluid (and maybe spallation waste?)
[lead spallation waste -> (dusts?) iridium, osmium, tungsten, hafnium, ytterbium, erbium]

//use collision_chamber to shoot positron and anti-proton fluid to make anti-hydrogen fluid (which then needs to be converted into anti-hydrogen gas?)

anti-hydrogen is used disintegrated ore

use uranium oxide gas to irradiate material in nucleosynthesizer

custom machines:
fluid centrifuge -> centrifuge
chemical mixer -> saltmixer
chemical reactor -> ~

32x:
ore -> disintegrated via antihydrogen
disintegrated -> royal via aqua regia
royal -> pain-free via painkiller mixer
pain-free -> bubbly via carbonic acid
bubbly -> item soda via crystallizer
item soda -> irradiated
irradiated -> dry-cleaned via perchloroethylene
dry-cleaned -> cleaned-pressed via pressure
16x:
cleaned-pressed -> destabilized via proton bombardment
destabilized -> spicy via secret-spices
spicy -> treated via fluorosulfuric acid
treated -> steam-cleaned via steam
steam-cleaned -> precipitate via crystallizer
8x:
precipitate -> dipped via dip fluid
dipped -> filtered via activated carbon
filtered -> dirty lump via crystallizer
dirty lump -> clean lump via ore leacher (aquaregia but with sulfuric acid as well)

mekanism: clean lump -> clean slurry 200mb
